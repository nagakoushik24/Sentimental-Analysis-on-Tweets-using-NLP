# Sentiment Analysis on Tweets using NLP

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify tweets from X (formerly Twitter) according to their sentiment and mood. Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we developed a robust model to determine whether a tweet is positive, negative, or neutral. The project enhances decision-making and provides insights into social media trends by analyzing real-time data.

## Features
- **Sentiment Classification**: Categorizes tweets into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
- **Advanced Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares tweet data, including tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and handling of emojis and hashtags.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves high accuracy through fine-tuning, hyperparameter optimization, and cross-validation.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Implements real-time sentiment analysis and visualization, allowing continuous monitoring of social media trends.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Presents analysis results through interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: 
  - NLP: NLTK, SpaCy, Hugging Face Transformers
  - Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
  - Web Framework: Flask (for API development)
- **Tools**: Tweepy (for data collection), Jupyter Notebook, Git
